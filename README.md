# Welcome to My Basecamp 1

## Task
What is basecamp?
It's a web-based project management tool launched in 2004. Its primary features are to-do lists, milestone management, forum-like messaging, file sharing, and time tracking - [basecamp.com](https://basecamp.com)

You will have a to create a website which mimique features from the original tools. It means having a database, a backend and a frontend.
